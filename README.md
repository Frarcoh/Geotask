# Geotask
Geotask is a collection of resources for the Geography IGCSE exam.
It was built with pure HTML, CSS and Javascript with the help of Bootstrap 5, for a responsive design, and Typewriter, for captivating headings. 

## How to access
You can access GeoTask by clicking the link on the right of the page or by clicking [here](https://geotasks.herokuapp.com).

## What is and why?
I wanted to build something that could help IGCSE Geography's students like me to have something to check everytime they need to. My friends and teachers gave me the motivation and the support to build this project together. 

## What you can do?
With Geotask you can consult resources like definitions, photos and tasks to help you master the final exam.
